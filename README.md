# Python Project: Instacart Grocery Basket Analysis
## *Careerfoundry Data Analytics Certification*

## Project Brief

**Objective**

Instacart is an online grocery store that operates through an app. Instacart already has very good sales, but they
want to uncover more information about their sales patterns. In the following project I will perform an initial data and exploratory analysis of some of their data in order
to derive insights and suggest strategies for better segmentation based on the provided criteria.

**Context**

The Instacart stakeholders are most interested in the variety of customers in their database along with their purchasing behaviors. 
They’re considering a targeted marketing strategy to see whether they have an effect on the sale of their products.
The following analysis will help to answer the stakeholder's key questions:

**Key Questions**

1. What are the busiest days of the week and hours of the day (i.e., the days and times with the most orders) in order to schedule ads at
times when there are fewer orders.

2. Are there particular times of the day when people spend the most money (this might inform the type of products that are advertise at these times).
  
3. Instacart has a lot of products with different price tags. Marketing and sales want to use simpler price range groupings to help direct their efforts.

4. Are there certain types of products that are more popular than others? The marketing and sales teams want to know which departments have the highest frequency of product orders.

5. The marketing and sales teams are particularly interested in the different types of customers in their system and how their ordering behaviors differ:
- What’s the distribution among users in regards to their brand loyalty (i.e., how often do they return to Instacart)?
- Are there differences in ordering habits based on a customer’s loyalty status?
- Are there differences in ordering habits based on a customer’s region?
- Is there a connection between age and family status in terms of ordering habits?
- What different classifications does the demographic information suggest? Age? Income? Certain types of goods? Family status?
- What differences can you find in ordering habits of different customer profiles? Consider e.g. the price of orders, the frequency of orders, the products customers are ordering.

**Stakeholders**

- Vice President of Marketing: “We’re always looking into improving our targeting for ad campaigns.”
- Senior Vice President of Sales: “We need to know what part of our offering has the lowest market share and why. Based on this input, we could improve this sector and
boost sales.”
- Instacart Customer: “I want to receive ads, promotions, and recommendations that are relevant to the products I order regularly.”
